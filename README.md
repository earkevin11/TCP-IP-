# TCP-IP Networking

# What is the main purpose of a network?
- To share information and resources with one another

# What are protocols?
- Networks work correctly because the various devices and software follow the rules (protocols).
- Protocols are a set of logical rules that devices must follow to communicate.

# What is a Networking model?
- Networking model defines rules about how each part of the network should work, as well as how the parts should work together so that the entire network functions correctly

# What is the purpose of a networking model?
- Networking models define a structure and different categories (layers) of standards and protocols.
- Think networking models as a set of architectural plans for building a house.
- To build a house, there are framers, electricians, bricklayers, painters, and more.
- One could build a house without the blueprint but the blueprint would ensure that the house would not collapse plus it would have hidden spaces to accomdate the plumbing, electrical, gas, and more.

# TCP / IP rules are used today
- TCP/IP became the common choice and OSI fell away

# Corporate networks are known as enterprise networks 
- Smaller networks at home, when used for business purposes are known as small office/home office (SOHO) networks

# TCP/IP Networking Model 
- This model allows us all to take a computer (or cellpgone) out of the box, plug in all the right cables, turn it on, and connect to and use the network.
